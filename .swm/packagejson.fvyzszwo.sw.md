# Introduction

This document will walk you through the key design decisions made in the <SwmPath>[package.json](/package.json)</SwmPath> file for the "noise maker project with mobile gestures". The <SwmPath>[package.json](/package.json)</SwmPath> file is crucial for defining the metadata and dependencies of the project, ensuring it runs correctly in the intended environment.

We will cover:
